This repository contains most files needed to run an airline website on local devices. Functionality of the website includes: user management (registration, login and logout, edit profile), searching of flights based on certain fields, booking flights with reservations as well as reservation management (edit, cancel). The website is ran on a local server, where the website's database resides. Proper OOP is observed.
